# Normalize-canvas-grades

This script allows you to re-weight canvas grades *within* an assignment group. This is something users have [requested](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Question-Forum/Weighting-Assignments-Within-an-Assignment-Group/td-p/177532) [many times](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Question-Forum/Assessment-weighting-within-assignment-groups/m-p/231193) but is still not possible within canvas.

Export your whole canvas gradebook as a csv and then follow the instructions in the R script.
